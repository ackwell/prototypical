Prototypical
============

***This README is incomplete!***

**Note:** This is a work in progress, and will be subject to change without notice. Probably without updated docs too, knowing myself.

Prototypical (working name) is a dynamically typed, interpreted language. I plan to keep the language and it's syntax as simple as possible, while allowing a great deal of ~~hackery~~ flexibility for the coder.

Syntax
------

The syntax borrows heavily from existing languages, so most constructs should seem familiar.

For a brief overview of the core concepts and syntax of the language, check out the [example code](https://github.com/ackwell/prototypical/blob/master/example.prt).
